# Unhandled Error in Asynchronous Node.js Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Node.js servers where an unhandled error during an asynchronous operation can lead to hanging requests.  The server does not properly close the response if the asynchronous operation fails.

## The Problem

The `bug.js` file contains a simple HTTP server that performs an asynchronous operation. If the asynchronous operation fails, the error is logged, but the response to the client is not closed. This can result in hanging requests and potential resource leaks.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the server. It uses a `try...catch` block to ensure that the response is always closed, regardless of whether the asynchronous operation succeeds or fails.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `node bug.js`.
3. Send multiple requests to the server (e.g., using `curl` or a browser).  Observe that some requests might hang.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js`.
5. Repeat step 3.  The requests should now complete properly even if the asynchronous operation fails.

## Key Learning

Always ensure that the response is properly closed in asynchronous Node.js servers, even if an error occurs.  Use `try...catch` blocks or appropriate error-handling mechanisms to guarantee resource cleanup.
